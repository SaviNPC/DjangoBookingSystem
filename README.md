# DjangoBookingSystem
Django webapp for a restaurant with menu items and booking system
This repo consists of a working app for a fake restaurant, done as a project to put to work skills in Django.
Project includes four webpages, a table booking/reservation system, and a dynamic menu-item display system.
This project was a way of putting to the test the development of a simple Django app, from views, models and templates to database design, DTL, and dynamic and static content rendering.
